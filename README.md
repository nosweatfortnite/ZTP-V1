# Zero Tolerance Policy

Welcome to Battlecraft Studios. Our official policy is based on maintaining a safe and respectful community.

## Policy Overview:
- If you violate Discord's Terms of Service (TOS) or the server's TOS, you may appeal under **Section 1: Opportunity for Correction**.
- This provides a second chance, depending on the severity of the infraction.
- Penalties may or may not be revoked based on the specifics of the case.

## When Penalties Will Not Be Revoked:
- Penalties will not be revoked if the infraction is logged under **Section 1: Sending Content with Intent to Harm Members**.
- This indicates a clear intention to harm the community or individual members.

## When Penalties May Be Revoked:
- Penalties may be revoked if the infraction is logged under **Section 1: Sending Content Without Intent to Harm Members**.
- In such cases, the individual did not intend harm and shows remorse.

# Opportunity for Correction under Section 1

At Battlecraft Studios, we believe in giving members a fair chance to correct their behavior, provided the infractions are not severe or malicious. Our process for handling violations under **Section 1** involves evaluating the intent and severity of the action, and offering opportunities for correction accordingly.

## Opportunities for Correction:

### 1. First Offense / Minor Violations
- **Description:** These are infractions that occur without malicious intent, such as accidental spam, minor rule breaches, or misunderstandings.
- **Assessment:** The member shows remorse and demonstrates understanding of the community rules.
- **Potential Outcomes:** 
  - The violation may be forgiven or reduced.
  - The member may receive a warning or temporary suspension.
  - The punishment can be revoked if the member complies with community standards and commits to future adherence.
- **Criteria for Reversal:** Genuine remorse, acknowledgment of mistake, and a commitment to follow rules in the future.

### 2. Repeated Offenses or Serious Violations
- **Description:** These involve repeated infractions or actions with clear malicious intent, harming the community or individual members.
- **Assessment:** The severity and intent behind the violation are taken into account.
- **Potential Outcomes:** 
  - Penalties are likely to be upheld or increased.
  - Reversal or revocation of punishment is unlikely.
  - This indicates a disregard for community standards and may lead to permanent bans or sanctions.
- **Criteria for Reversal:** Generally not applicable unless new evidence or extenuating circumstances are presented.

## Important Note:
- Each case is reviewed individually, and decisions are made at the discretion of the moderation team.
- Members are encouraged to appeal if they believe a punishment was unjustified, providing context and remorse if applicable.
